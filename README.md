# WAL
Window Abstraction Library

WAL is a minimalist library written in ANSI C (std 1989) to work with OpenGL, it can work on X11 or WinAPI.
Supports RGBA and Depth.
It also offers a simple interface to access mouse coordinates and detect keyboard actions. I needed to do some experiments with OpenGL but I didn't want to use large libraries like SFML or SDL, so I created WAL, it doesn't offer as many functionalities as the ones mentioned above but it's extremely simple and easy to adapt to specific requirements.
